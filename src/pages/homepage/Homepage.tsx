        <p>Lets build refine hackaton my bro.</p>

        <p>Note: I've removed every existing folder and file, and left the components and pages folder</p>
        <p>the pages will house the different pages/routes, and the components will house the components of those pages/routes</p>
        <p>so right now, we have an homepage and auth folder in both components and pages folder.</p>
    </div>
